# Game Java Application

## Description

This is a multi-level game developed in Java. The game consists of five different levels where the player must defeat all enemies to progress to the next level. User progress is saved in a `.txt` file that stores usernames and the highest level reached.

The application is structured around several classes, with `MainClass`, `Game`, `GamePanel`, and `GameWindow` being the primary ones.

## Documentation

The project uses Javadoc for documentation. Generate the Javadoc files with the following command:

javadoc -d doc -sourcepath src -subpackages .

This command will create documentation in the 'doc' directory, sourcing information from the 'src' directory and all its subpackages.
